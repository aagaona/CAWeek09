//Overview:
//Building out WAR! Game
//Players flip cards from the the top of deck high number wins, Aces are High
//Ties result in no point > return card to the player to avoid loosing a card from the deck
//Win gives that player 1 point
//Play continues until all cards have been used (in the real game cards are added back to the bottom of your deck > this may result in an infinte game)
    //to avoid this added a point cap

//Plan:
//Players need to play cards from hand
//Players need to recieve cards whern they win
//Deck must be shuffled (Rnd.Numbers)
//Cards must be given to players - "dealt in" (Rnd)
//Track Score to determine a winner
//Could display name of winner per flip 
//Display Winner and Score at the end
