//Overview:
//Building out WAR! Game
//Players flip cards from the the top of deck high number wins, Aces are High
//Ties result in no point
//Win gives that player 1 point
//Play continues until all cards have been used (cards are not reshuffled into the deck, 1 round uses 52 cards)

//Plan:
//Players need to play cards from hand
//Players need to recieve cards
//Deck must be shuffled (Rnd.Numbers)
//Cards must be given to players (Rnd)
//Track Score
//Could display name of winner per flip and current score
//Display Winner and Score at the end
